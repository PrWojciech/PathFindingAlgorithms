Currently underdevelopment.
For now I've implemented :
- adding walls by clicking and dragging on the grid
- Dijkstra algorithm(works as BFS because I didn't
  implemented weighted nodes yet ) - under button "dijkstra"
- DeepFirstSearch -  under the button "DFS"
- cleaning the grid (gets reseted to default condition) - under button "clean"
- animation both for searching finish node and for path drawing(for Dijkstra the shortest path)
